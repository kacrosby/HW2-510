## Patterns + Selenium Testing

#### OO Patterns

There are many design patterns that have been defined and used in building software. For object-oriented design patterns, they can be described in [three major categories](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns):

* Creational Patterns
* Structural patterns
* Behavioral patterns

Define and describe 2 design patterns from each category.

#### Free Style

Design patterns have been critized for being too specific and artifically limited by OO language constraints. Find and describe any pattern that may be useful in building software.

Define and describe 3 patterns that you have found.

## SELENIUM (50 points)

You will help test out a survey hosting site, http://checkbox.io

Write unit tests using Selenium that verify the following:
http://checkbox.io/studies.html

* The participant count of "Frustration of Software Developers" is 55
* The total number of studies closed is 5.
* If a status of a study is open, you can click on a "Participate" button.
* Check if the "Software Changes Survey" has a Amazon reward image.

## Evaluation
